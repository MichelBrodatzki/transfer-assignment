# The Rabbit Who Wanted to Learn Git

In the heart of a lush, green forest lived a curious little rabbit named Benny. Benny loved exploring new things, from burrows and tunnels to the latest gadgets brought by the forest's human visitors. One day, Benny overheard a conversation between two hikers about something called "Git," which they described as a way to keep track of changes in their work. Intrigued, Benny decided he wanted to learn Git, even though he wasnâ€™t quite sure what it was.
